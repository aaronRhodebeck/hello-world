This is the repository made while following the tutorial

My name is Aaron Rhodebeck, I am a technology enthusiast and I have been working in the technology field for a few years now.  I recently decided to commit to fully learn to write software after experimenting with it off and on my whole life.  I am excited about this adventure and my goal is to one day be able to create the tools I have always wanted for my work with community theater.
